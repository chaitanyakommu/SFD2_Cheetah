Hi,my name is Ravi.
I am from Melbourne, Australia.
I don't have any favourite place. 
I am attending this program because I have an interest in software and web development, and looking for skills for a brighter future.
Best day of my life - Everyday is a best day for me.
I don't watch movies.I like documentaries narrated by David Attenbourough.
My family is most important to me.
